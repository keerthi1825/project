        Bharatanatyam is one of the oldest and most popular classical dance forms of India, originating from the state of Tamil Nadu. It is known for its fixed upper torso, bent legs, and intricate footwork combined with expressive hand gestures (mudras) and facial expressions (abhinaya). The dance form is traditionally performed by women  and is often associated with Hindu religious themes and spiritual ideas, particularly those related to the god Shiva. Bharatanatyam performances are usually accompanied by classical Carnatic music and involve a combination of pure dance (nritta) and expressive dance (nritya). The dance form has a rich history and is deeply rooted in Indian culture and tradition.</p>
