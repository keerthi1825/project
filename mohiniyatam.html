        Mohiniyatam, also spelled Mohiniyattam, is a classical dance form from the Indian state of Kerala. It is known for its graceful and feminine movements, often depicting themes of love and devotion. The dance is characterized by its slow, swaying movements and intricate footwork, accompanied by expressive hand gestures and facial expressions. Mohiniyatam is traditionally performed by women and is often associated with the worship of the Hindu goddess Mohini, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. The dance form has a rich history and is deeply rooted in the cultural and religious traditions of Kerala.</p>
