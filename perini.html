        Perini, also known as Perini Sivatandavam, is a traditional dance form from the Indian state of Telangana. It is a vigorous and energetic dance that was historically performed by warriors before going into battle, invoking the blessings of Lord Shiva. The dance is characterized by powerful movements, rhythmic footwork, and dynamic expressions, often accompanied by traditional percussion instruments like the dhol and cymbals. Perini is traditionally performed by men and is known for its intense and masculine energy. The dance form has seen a revival in recent years and is now performed on various cultural platforms, showcasing its rich heritage and significance in Telangana's history and culture.</p>
